AndEngineAnimate
================

AndEngine Animation classes.  Use with update handlers to move objects.
NOTE:  I haven't updated these in quite a while.  They may not be compatible with the current version of AndEngine.
This repository is designed to be used with sprites or entities to animate them in various ways.
This will include animations that can do the following:

move an object between two points with a certain speed in mind. 
revolve an object around a given point 
make an object move up and down across a region
make an object move left and right across a region
make an object move left and right in a wave pattern
make an object move up and down in a wave pattern
